## Day 1 : Complete Git and GitHub

# What is Git and Github?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes to files and allows users to merge and manage different versions of a project.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for developers to store, manage, and share their code with others. GitHub offers additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools, making it popular for open-source projects and team collaborations.

# Why are we using Git and Github?
we use Git and GitHub because they offer a robust and efficient way to manage and collaborate on software development projects. Git helps us track changes and work on different branches, while GitHub provides a convenient online platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
