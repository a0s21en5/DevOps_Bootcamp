## Day 1 : Complete Git and GitHub

# What is Git and Github?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes to files and allows users to merge and manage different versions of a project.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for developers to store, manage, and share their code with others. GitHub offers additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools, making it popular for open-source projects and team collaborations.
