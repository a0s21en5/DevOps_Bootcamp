## Day 1 : Complete Git and GitHub

> What is Git? 
>* Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and folders over time, allowing users to work on different versions simultaneously and merge their modifications seamlessly.

> What Github? 
>* GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides hosting services for Git repositories and adds additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. GitHub enables developers to share their code, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with others easily.

## Why are we using Git and Github?
> Git and GitHub are used for version control, enabling collaboration, backup, and recovery of code, as well as facilitating open-source contributions and project management in software development.
