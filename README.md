# Day 1 : Complete Git and GitHub

> What is Git and Github? 
>* Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and folders over time, allowing users to work on different versions simultaneously and merge their modifications seamlessly.

>* GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides hosting services for Git repositories and adds additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. GitHub enables developers to share their code, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with others easily.
